# Euler
Solutions to the first 10 Project Euler problems

Each file corresponds to one problem on https://projecteuler.net/archives
Each file contains the problem description in the opening comments and an explanation of the solution
Each solution is printed in the output, usually formatted to be input into Project Euler but sometimes displays the solution for other unknowns, for instance Problem #9 requires you to find a triplet of a,b,c and return the sum as an answer, but the program displays a,b,c and the sum as its output
